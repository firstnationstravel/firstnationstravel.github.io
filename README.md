# firstnationstravel.github.io

Testbed for an app for travel info about First Nations in Canada. To do: Toggle overlay of First Nations on/off, calculate time and distance and suggest items of interest. A table below the map lists names and locations of places in the overlay.

https://firstnationstravel.github.io appears to be a static web page with only one dependency, First-Nations-Locations.kmz, however the HTML file loads icons and JavaScript libraries from CDNJS and fonts, map data, satellite imagery and street views from Google and uses Google's directions service, while the KMZ file loads a dynamic map overlay from: http://data.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/geomatics/services/Donnees_Ouvertes-Open_Data/Premiere_Nation_First_Nation/MapServer/KmlServer
