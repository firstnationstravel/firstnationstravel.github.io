# firstnationstravel.github.io

A testbed for an app for travel info about First Nations in Canada. To do: Toggle overlay of First Nations on/off, calculate time and distance and suggest items of interest. The blank page below the map will be used for a table of additional locations.

firstnationstravel.github.io/index.html appears to be a static web page with only one dependency, First-Nations-Travel.kmz, however the HTML file loads icons and JavaScript libraries from CDNJS and fonts, map data, satellite imagery and street views (where available) from Google and uses Google's directions service, while the KMZ file loads a dynamic map overlay from: http://data.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/geomatics/services/Donnees_Ouvertes-Open_Data/Premiere_Nation_First_Nation/MapServer/KmlServer
